Hi there! This is my current working directory for everything related to my foray into single-cell RNAseq analysis. As a newcomer to this area, I've been greatly assisted by the Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis (OSCA) guide available through Bioconductor. Many of my notebooks here will thus show lots of the code from that tutorial and my manipulations of it.

For work on interpretable ML for RNAseq analysis, see my notebook `lt_interpret.Rmd`.

For a still quite nascent work on my attempts at replication of analysis of longitudinal lung cancer data, see my notebook `lt_analysis.Rmd`.

For a quite close replication of parts of the OSCA tutorial, but on a different dataset, as well as a deeper investigation of various clustering methods, see my notebook `glioblastoma_2014_patel/analysis.Rmd`.

For an (also quite nascent) investigation of the utility of the GLMPCA method for feature selection (which uses the deviance to select features, instead of the more traditional variance), see my notebook `compare_glmpca.Rmd`.

As you may be able to tell, this repo is in a very fluid and active state, and there is much to be desired in way of documentation.
